# Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Distributed System with Machine Learning-Based Attack Detection

## Overview
This project implements a Byzantine fault-tolerant distributed system in C, enhanced with machine learning-based attack detection mechanisms. It aims to ensure consensus among distributed nodes even in the presence of faulty or malicious actors.

## Features
- **Consensus Algorithms**: Implements PBFT and Honey Badger BFT.
- **Networking**: Robust communication between nodes.
- **Machine Learning**: Detects and mitigates attacks using ML models.
- **Attack Simulation**: Simulates various attack scenarios to test system resilience.
- **Formal Verification**: Ensures the correctness of consensus mechanisms.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests to validate functionalities.
